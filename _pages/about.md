Greetings! I‚Äôm Bo Yang. My research interests are primarily focused on Deep Learning for audio and speech related challenges, computer vision, and signal processing. Presently, I am gaining research experience as an intern at NXP within the RAISE project. My MSc thesis centers around the optimization of the innovative Complex-Real Value Neural Network (CRVNN) developed by NXP. My primary focus lies within the realm of autoML, particularly in areas such as Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). I leverage autoML frameworks like Optuna to enhance both the architecture and other hyperparameters of the CRVNN. Then use optimized NN to do audio related application such as speech enhancement. I just finished my MSc defense and graduated with a Cum Laude in TU/e. Currently I'm looking PhD positions.

# üíª Internships
- *2023.12 - 2024.09, Research Intern*, **NXP**, Eindhoven NL

	- I am a part of the ML&AI department at NXP, where my role centers around the optimization of the innovative Complex-Real Value Neural Network (CRVNN) developed by NXP.
	- My primary focus lies within the realm of autoML, particularly in areas such as Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
	- I leverage autoML frameworks like Optuna and NNI to enhance both the architecture and other hyperparameters of the CRVNN. Additionally, I am actively involved in crafting automated procedures for the design of this novel network.
	- My responsibilities extend to the development of an architecture optimization framework, followed by efforts to enhance the interpretability and explainability of the network. Once the CRVNN architecture is refined, I apply it to specific tasks, such as optimizing its performance for applications like hearing aids.

- *2023.07 - 2023.12, Research Intern*, **IMEC**, Eindhoven NL

	- In my role as a research intern with the UWB4z group at IMEC, my primary responsibility is to enhance the accuracy of range estimation and localization for UWB devices in diverse environments.
	- I delve into the development of innovative algorithms and construct efficient neural networks to elevate the precision of UWB devices. Through a comprehensive analysis of UWB signal characteristics, I introduced a cutting-edge neural network architecture named 'STMnet'.
	- This architecture, when integrated with IMEC's internal algorithm, resulted in a significant enhancement in range estimation performance compared to established methods. The successful outcomes of this work have been documented and published in the International Symposium on Joint Communications & Sensing 2024.
